Business analytics projects using SQL and Power BI to drive performance insights in supply chain

# Functional Nutrition Analytics

This project showcases business analytics work from my role as a Category & Procurement Manager at a global health supplements startup.

## 🔍 Business Objective
Use data to optimize demand planning, supplier margin, and inventory efficiency across EU, US, and Asia operations.  Due to senstiive data I used mock examples of different reporting structures I would use

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL & MySQL)
- Power BI and tempo live connections
- Excel // Google sheets

## 📈 Key Contributions
- Built KPI dashboards to track supplier performance, margin, and stock turnover.
- Used SQL queries to analyze sell-through rates and overstock risk.
- Automated reporting processes for procurement and finance teams.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/SQL` – Sample anonymized queries for supplier analysis and inventory performance  
- `/Dashboards` – Screenshots and descriptions of Power BI dashboards  
- `/Insights` – Business outcomes and analysis stories

## 💡 Outcomes
- Reduced stock holding value by 6%  
- Increased gross margin by 0.78% across 1600 SKUs  
- Improved decision-making speed for senior leadership


## 📊 Supply Chain Analytics – Data Cleaning Dashboard

This Excel workbook demonstrates mock data cleaning steps typically performed before importing data into Power BI for visualization. It mimics real-world supply chain datasets and outlines how to transform messy inputs into clean, analysis-ready outputs.

**Key Features:**
- Cleaning inconsistent naming conventions
- Removing blank/null values
- Formatting date and product categories
- Creating calculated columns (e.g., lead time, delivery status)

- Power BI Data Integration with Tempo
This dashboard was built using live connections to Tempo project management data across three active retail channels:

Power BI Tempo Connector – Platform 1

Power BI Tempo Connector –Platform 2

Power BI Tempo Connector – Platform 3

By connecting to these data sources, I was able to:

Create real-time refreshable reports

Maintain centralized governance using Power BI service

Use Power Query to apply data transformations
